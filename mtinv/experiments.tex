Describe and justify your chosen methodology. Include comparisons with appropriate baselines and simple methods. In addition to common evaluation metrics such as accuracy or false positive rate, define and employ metrics of relevance to the problem domain. How does the domain measure success? 

The paper MUST include a careful discussion of the results and what the implications are for the problem of interest. Papers that simply present a table of results or a "bake-off" without this analysis may be rejected without review.
